# Maya Plugins
Here are some of the Maya plugins I have worked on! Click on the plugin to go to its section: 
* [Plant Generator Plugin](https://github.com/nMDaas/MayaPlugins/tree/main#plant-generator-plugin)
* [AI Standard Surface Substance Painter Plugin](https://github.com/nMDaas/MayaPlugins/tree/main#ai-standard-surface-substance-painter-plugin)

## How To Use Any Plugin
* Download folder for the plugin you want to use
* In the execute.py file, update the line with "folder =" to be the path to the plugin folder on your computer
* Open the "execute_tool.py" file in the Maya script editor
* Run the script

## Plant Generator Plugin
This is an ongoing project that enables rapid creation of stylized and customizable plants using variations of an existing model.
* This tool can quickly generate variations of a leaf from a base model using distortion, tilting and scaling
* The user can swiftly distribute of leaves around an object (like a stem) or in a concentrated location
